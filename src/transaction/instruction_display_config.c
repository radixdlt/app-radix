#include "instruction_display_config.h"

// Used in CMakeLists.txt for unit test so we can write `add_library(instruction_display_config
// ../src/transaction/instruction_display_config.c)`. This is kind of hacky and surely we can do
// better, I just lack the CMake knowledge to improve this. Please feel free to fix!
